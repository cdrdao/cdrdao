We keep a copy of old ANTLR 1.33 source code here, in case we need to
modify the TOC file format and regenerate the TOC parser. The
generated parser code is cross-OS and stable and is therefore kept in
the git repository, rather than being regenerated everytime cdrdao is
built from a tarball.

We provide a simple custom Makefile to build antlr from source and
generate the toc parser.

To build antlr 1.33:

> make

To regenerate the TOC parser:

> make regen
