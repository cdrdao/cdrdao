--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.2.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o gcdmaster port to GTK 3 (Stefan Roellin)

  o Support to specify encoding in TOC (Denis Leroy):
    - one of ENCODING_ISO_8859_1, ENCODING_ASCII, ENCODING_MS_JIS,
      ENCODING_KOREAN, ENCODING_MANDARIN may be specified on LANGUAGE
      section.
    - TOC always dumped in UTF-8, unless --no-utf8 is specified

  o Fix --swap argument with generic-mmc-raw driver (Alex Free)

  o MacOS fixes (DL)

  o cdrdao:
    - new cdtext command to dump CD-TEXT disc content
    - deprecate 0x10 driver option by checking device configuration

  o toc2cue: (Jonathan Simpson)
    - add option to convert bin file, removing subchannel data that
      isn't supported by cue/bin files
    - add option to swap byte order when creating new bin file

  o toc2mp3: (DL)
    - -J option to force specific text decoding
    - support for character encoding in filenames and id3v2 tags

  o Fix eject by first issuing PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL (DL)

  o Removed scsilib snapshot from old cdrecord project, only use
    native interface. RIP JÃ¶rg Schilling.

  o Misc patches from Fedora:
    - compile and warning fixes for newer C++ compilers
    - lame 3.100 support
    - pccts format security patch
    - man page fix

  o Many C++ compiler fixes (Nick Bailey)

  o MacOS compile fixes, upstreamed from brew

  o Cddb server updates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.2.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o  Fixed compile issues with glibc >= 2.12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.2.3 (2009-10-05)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o  By default, cdrdao tries to build with a native SCSI interface. Use
    "--with-libscg" to use bundled libscg library. (Denis Leroy)

 o  Complete rewrite of native Linux SG driver for SG 3.0 using SG_IO
    ioctl. That should make it behave better with ConsoleKit based
    permissions environment. Cdrdao should now be compiled on Linux
    without cdrtools by using "--without-scglib". (Denis Leroy)

 o  Added support for new FIRST_TRACK_NO keyword to allow a CD to start
    with a track number other than 1. (Edgar Fuss)

 o  Added native interfaces for Irix, Mac OSX and NetBSD. (Edgar Fuss)

 o  Fixed old pregap length off-by-one error, see bug #604751
    (Thomas Vander Stichele)

 o  Fixed bug in Toc file parser track length computation. (Denis Leroy)

 o  Man page typo fixes. (Denis Leroy)

 o  Cygwin compilation fixes. Other various compilation warning
    fixes. (Denis Leroy)

 o  Some scsilib fixes for FreeBSD, 32-bit and 64-bit SPARC. (Marius
    Strobl)

 o  Some makefile changes to avoid conflict with installed system libs.
    (Marius Strobl)

 o  Added patch to fix ARM and MIPS scsilib compile (Kedar Sovani, Debian)

 o  Added man pages for toc2cue and toc2cddb, from Debian.

 o  Move privilege drop earlier in main flow (based on Debian patch)

 o  Commited Gentoo patch for CD-TEXT track check fix (Grant, Peter Alfredsen)

GCDMaster changes:

 o  Preferences now stored in GConf, exports schema file (Denis Leroy)

 o  Added simple Preferences dialog to change temporary file directory
    (Denis Leroy)

 o  Fixed GCC 4.3 compilation issues (Denis Leroy)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.2.2 (2006-09-20)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o  Added device locking for win32 (Giuseppe Corbelli)

 o  Man page cleanup (Andrew Suffield)

GCDMaster changes:

 o  Fixed GCC 4.1 compilation issues

 o  Fixed hang when inserting WAV file


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.2.1 (2005-10-28)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o  Fixed bad bug with missing return statemements in recomputeLength
    and format conversion.

 o  Fixed broken '-' STDIN input feature.

 o  Fixed various gcc4-related compile problems.

 o  Fixed copy problem with single device when read_device is
    specified.

 o  Added autodetect of cdrtools header files in configure

 o  Minor fixes to driver table.

 o  pccts build is now better integrated with automake/autoconf.

 o  Added FreeBSD 7 support to configure.ac. Fixed libao dependency.

GCDMaster changes:

 o  The crash when creating a new "Create Audio CD" view seemed to be
    related to gtkmm and libsigc++ and went away with newer releases of
    those packages.

toc2cue changes:

 o  toc2cue: fixed bug that was causing empty output files.

 o  Added conversion of COPY to DCP flags. (Julio Sanchez Fernandez)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.2.0 (2005-05-12)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o  SECURITY FIX: cdrdao now gives up its root privileges after setting
    up real-time scheduling, as well as before saving settings through
    the --save option. This fixes a potential local root exploit when
    cdrdao is installed with the +s chmod flag. Using --save now also
    forces an early exit after the settings are saved.

 o  Added MP3 and Ogg Vorbis file support (through respectively the
    libmad and libvorbis libraries). cdrdao will decode the MP3 and
    Ogg files into temporary WAV files that will be deleted upon exit
    (unless the new option --keep is used). The directory used to
    store those temporary WAV files can be specified with the --tmpdir
    option (default is /tmp).

 o  Improved native CUE file support: replaced old incomplete existing
    parser with the one from Matthias Czapla's excellent
    cue2toc. Added support for cutting binary files.

 o  Added --rspeed option to manually set the device reading speed. Be
    warned not all devices support this.

 o  Packaged scsilib library upgraded from cdrtools 2.01 (previously
    was from 2.01a31).

 o  Added --no-mode2-mixed option. Don't read a MODE2 disk as
    MODE2_FORM_MIXED, only read MODE2_FORM1 or MODE2_FORM2 (Matthieu
    Castet).

 o  Added help for little-known drive-info command.

GCDMaster changes:

 o  MP3 and Ogg Vorbis support: you can drag and drop .mp3, .m3u and
    .ogg files from Nautilus into the sample display window.

 o  Switched to gtkmm24 API. Improved file browsers.

 o  CUE files support.

 o  Sound output now uses libao library.

 o  Added 'Select All' item in menu.

 o  Added 'Eject' button to progress dialog

 o  Bug fixes (sample selection weirdness, couldn't close window during
    play, problems with gcdmaster command-line argument, crashes with
    multiple project windows, drive status not reported correctly).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.9 (2004-06-07)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o MMC-driver auto-detection. If no --driver option is specified,
   cdrdao will try to autodetect an MMC-compliant device and use the
   generic-mmc driver by default. (Denis Leroy)

 o Included scsilib upgraded from cdrtools 2.01a31 (Denis Leroy)

 o Added --eject option to the unlock command to eject the cd after
   unlocking. (Eric Benson)

 o New 'discid' command to display CDDB information. (Eric Benson,
   Denis Leroy).

 o Fixed scsilib compiling problems with Linux kernel 2.6 (Jim Gifford)

 o Fixed compiling problems with gcc 3.4 (Jim Gifford, Denis Leroy)

 o Added --full-burn and --capacity options to extend lead-out to entire disc,
   beyond 80 mins limit. (Vladimir Petrov)


GCDMaster changes (Denis Leroy):

 o Device configuration dialog now scans for devices on both ATA and
   ATAPI interfaces.

 o Some bug fixes (manual driver configurations were not being saved
   correctly).

cue2toc changes:

 o Version 0.2 released. Complete rewrite, should now handle most of all
   CUE files. (Matthias Czapla)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.8 (2004-02-12)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o We have not heard from project founder and maintainer Andreas
   Mueller for a long time and do not know what his intentions are
   regarding cdrdao. Due to recent contributions to the project, we
   have decided to nonetheless continue development and to keep
   working towards future releases. Manuel Clos is now acting as
   project maintainer. We hope to hear from Andreas soon.

 o The latest state of the CVS tree before the merge with the
   Gnome2/Gtk2 branch has been tagged as 'Andreas_1_1_7'.

 o Improved performance of the new L-EC code by up to a factor 2 depending
   on the hardware.

 o 'read-test' runs L-EC encoder over mode 1 or mode 2 form 1 sectors to
   allow performance testing in conjunction with option --speed.

 o Fix for building on Mac OS X with gcc-3.1 (SF patch 611423).

 o Support for ATAPI drives: device is now specified as
   [path:]<x,y,z>, such as '--device 0,0,0' or '--device
   ATAPI:0,1,0'. If you run Linux 2.6, you can also use the latest
   /dev/hd* interface with '--device ATA:0,0,0' (Denis Leroy)

GCDMaster changes (Denis Leroy):

 o gcdmaster was ported to Gnome2/Gtk+2 using the new C++ Gtk2 bindings
   (gtkmm2 and gnomeuimm2).

 o ATAPI drives support: gcdmaster will also scan for ATAPI
   devices. Devices are now specified as a '[path:]x,y,z' string.

 o The samples selection can now be cleared (i.e. unselected) by
   single-clicking the Audio view during Select mode (not in Zoom
   mode).

 o You can now select multiple files from the file selector when
   appending or inserting tracks/files from the main Audio Project menu.

 o Some features have been removed (temporarily): the multiple views
   feature, the 'zoom to selection' icon. Also the progress dialog is
   gone during import: progress is shown on the main status bar.

mp32dao changes:

 o FLAC support. mp32dao now handles mp3/ogg/flac files. (Giuseppe Corbelli)

 o new: toc2cddb: translates a TOC file into a cddb file. (Giuseppe Corbelli)

 o new: cue2toc: convert CUE to TOC format for audio CDs. (Matthias Czapla)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.7 (2002-10-06)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Fixed crash in toc-file reader (only occurred for a certain type of
   syntactical error).

 o Fixed compilation problems of "toc2mp3.cc" with pre gcc-3.x compilers.

 o Updated driver table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.6 (2002-09-16)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Fixed cue sheet setup for CD-TEXT writing. Some older drives did not like
   the cue sheet format as specified in the latest SCSI-3/mmc
   specification.

 o Added sub-channel writing for the 'generic-mmc' and
   'generic-mmc-raw' driver. Currently only the R-W sub-channels can
   be written. The track image files may contain packed or raw R-W
   sub-channel data. For packed sub-channel data the L-EC data will be
   calculated and interleaving will be performed if required by the
   recording hardware.

 o Added sub-channel reading support for the generic-mmc(-raw) driver.
   Currently packed and raw R-W sub-channel reading is supported
   (option -read-subchan).

 o Added automatic check for support sub-channel reading modes to the
   'generic-mmc(-raw)' driver. The driver options (0x1, 0x2 and 0x20)
   should be obsolete now, but are still available.

 o The data track extraction with the generic-mmc(-raw) driver is more
   robust against read errors now. The
   --tao-source/--tao-source-adjust option should be obsolete now -
   but is still available.

 o Added on-the-fly copying support for the Win32 version.

 o Default blanking mode is now 'minimal' (SF feature request 425321)

 o Updated paranoia libraries to version of cdparanoia-III-alpha9.8.

 o Fixed waiting loop that was used to wait until the lead-out was written
   and until a blanking operation is finished. Some drives do not
   indicate this activities with a "not ready" status. Affected
   drivers: generic-mmc and generic-mmc-raw (blanking only).
 
 o Fixed crash in cdrdao usage printing (SF bug 570156).

 o Fixed cue sheet setup for ISRC codes for the HP8100 recorder model.

 o Added/fixed SF patches 427753, 450058 and 534214.

 o New mp32dao version from Giuseppe Corbelli with these new features:
   - Ogg support
   - MP3/Ogg decoding supported only with external programs
   - Code modularization and bugfixes
   - cdrecord's .inf file support for CD-TEXT data

 o Cue parser accepts spaces and '\' characters in file name now.

 o The PCCTS package is now a part of the cdrdao source code distribution
   which should avoid some compilation hassle.

 o Updated scsilib version.

 o Added patches for compilation under Unixware (incl. patches for scsilib).

 o Created new utility 'toc2mp3' that converts an audio CD image to a set
   of mp3 files using the LAME encoder. The encoded mp3 files have no
   gap at the end so that they play in sequence without noise at the
   transition points.


GCDMaster changes:

 o Gcdmaster hotkeys are now back. (SourceForge bug 470864).

 o Gcdmaster can now copy cds with just one drive, thanks to Das Poelzi for
   the patch. (SourceForge bug 566948).

 o Added switch to enable the overburn mode to the recording options box.

 o Added selection of the sub-channel reading mode the CD extraction options
   box.

 o Fixed the 'Cancel' button staying disabled in the Recording/Reading progress
   window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.5 (2001-04-29)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Fixed bug in CD-TEXT writing code that caused the problems with the
   unreliable read back of the written CD-TEXT data

 o Added CD-TEXT writing capability to the 'generic-mmc-raw' driver; the
   recorder must support the 96 byte raw P-W sub-channel writing mode to
   make use of it

 o Fixed bug in generic-mmc-raw driver: the TOC type was not written correctly
   and some flags for data tracks were missing in the lead-in

 o Fixed handling of toc type for multi session CDs: the toc-type of
   a session that just contains audio tracks is always CD_DA, even in multi
   session mode

 o BURN Proof support added by ITOH Yasufumi/Martin Buck

 o Fixed bug in calculating the CDDB id (SourceForge bug 413467)

 o Added option --with-cddb to read CDDB data automatically with commands
   'copy', 'read-toc' and 'read-cd'; it is now possible to add CD-TEXT data
   from CDDB while performing an on-the-fly copy

 o Updated to libscg-0.5 from cdrtools-1.10

 o Handle drives that do not support the explicit power calibration command

 o Blanking of CD-RWs is now officially supported (command 'blank',
   option --blank-mode)

 o Updated CD-R vendor table

 o Settings are now first read from "/etc/cdrdao.conf" and
   "/etc/defaults/cdrdao" and then from "$HOME/.cdrdao"

 o Added command 'msinfo' to output multi session information suitable for
   'mkisofs'

 o Overburning is now prevented by default and must be explicitly requested
   with option '--overburn'. Fix for Debian bug #79585
   (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=79585&repeatmerged=yes).

 o Fixed error in cdrdao's manual page (Debian bug #82816,
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=82816&repeatmerged=yes)

 o cdrdao's help screen was reworked by Michael Reinelt

 o Added Giuseppe Corbelli's enhancements for the 'mp32dao' script

 o Makefiles now use make variable 'datadir' to specify the share directory
   location

 o Fixed printing toc-file name with command 'copy --keepimage'


GCDMaster changes:

 o Added missing 'toshiba' driver to the device configuration dialog
  (SourceForge bug 128633)

 o Removed the CD-TEXT table entry dialog from the 'Project Info' dialog;
   it is now a non modal dialog on its own

 o Enhanced progress display for extracting and recording

 o Major rework of the infra structure to support multiple projects (toc-files)
   and multiple views of a project

 o Gcdmaster starts with a project chooser now; this is the first step
   to support different project types like data CD, mixed mode CD,
   video CD etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.4 (2000-08-27)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Created new 'toshiba' driver for 'read-toc'/'read-cd' with Toshiba
   CD-ROM drives.

 o Added full multi session support to the 'cdd2600' driver.

 o CD-TEXT is written without any copy protection flags now.

 o Added CDDB access to add title and artist data as CD-TEXT to an
   existing toc-file. The direct cddbp and the http encapsulated protocol
   is supported.

 o Added support to better handle disks written in track-at-once mode with
   'read-cd' and 'read-toc' (see options --tao-source and --tao-source-adjust).

 o Fixed bug that prevented recording of pure data CDs with the recent HP
   and Sony recorder models in single session mode.
   For multi session mode the restrictions mentioned in the README are
   still valid.

 o Fixed 'unit not ready' problems after writing with the 'generic-mmc'
   and 'generic-mmc-raw' driver.

 o Toc-files with tracks that are shorter than 4 seconds will be recorded
   if option '--force' is given.

 o Some of the command line options are now saved to a settings file
   "$HOME/.cdrdao" if option '--save' is given.

 o The driver database is now kept in an external file so it is possible
   to update the database between the cdrdao releases. Actual driver 
   database files will be available from

     http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html#dt

 o Added new option '--keepimage' which keeps the created image file after
   the command 'copy' finishes.

 o Fixed bug in CD-TEXT reading code: CD-TEXT fields with empty strings were
   only read for the first track.

 o Driver 'generic-mmc': If the power calibration fails the recording process
   will be aborted now.

 o Driver 'generic-mmc-raw': Added explicit power calibration.


Xcdrdao changes:

 o Xcdrdao is now a Gnome application and will be called "Gnome CD Master"
   (gcdmaster) in future.

 o Added table wise entry of CD-TEXT title/performer data.

 o Added a dialog to extract a CD to the hard disk.

 o Added a dialog to do CD to CD copy, with "on the fly" as an option.

 o Speed and record buffer are now selectable in the GUI.

 o When reading/duplicating a CD you can set the paranoia mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Data track writing is available with all drivers, especially the
   'ricoh-mp6200' and 'generic-mmc-raw' can write data tracks now.

 o Added DAE capability based on Monty's paranoia library to all drivers.
   The 'plextor' driver will still use the special Plextor method for DAE
   with Plextor drives but it is possible to force using the paranoia mode
   with a driver option (see README). The paranoia mode can customized with
   option '--paranoia-mode #'. Please read section 'Digital Audio Extraction'
   of the README.

 o 'read-cd' creates now a complete image of a session. All tracks are written
   to a single image file (comparable to a .bin file). Pre-gaps and index marks
   of audio tracks are extracted while ripping the audio data so that a
   'read-toc' step is obsolete now.
   It may choke on CDs written in TAO mode.

 o Experimental: Added a 'copy' command that performs all steps for copying a
   CD session with a single or two drives. By default a temporary image file
   is created in the current working directory. On the fly copying can be
   selected with option '--on-the-fly' which avoids the temporary image file.
   Copying of mixed mode CDs should be fine.
   I expect problems with source CDs written in TAO mode but I did not make
   any tests up to now.
   On the fly copying is not available for the Win32 platform, yet.
   Please read section 'Example for CD Copying' of the README.

 o 'read-cd' ignores sectors with L-EC errors now if option '--read-raw' is
   given. The 'cdd2600', 'ricoh-mp6200' and 'generic-mmc-raw' driver will
   recreate the erroneous sectors when recording.

 o Added full multi session support to the 'teac-cdr55' driver.

 o Added multiple language support for CD-TEXT. However, I have currently no
   access to a CD-TEXT capable consumer CD-player so I am not sure if CD-TEXT
   recording still works. Reading the written CD-TEXT data with a CD-ROM
   drive gives the expected results.

 o ATAPI CD-ROM drives that were only working with the 'plextor' driver
   should now be supported by the 'generic-mmc' driver with driver option 0x20
   (--driver generic-mmc:0x20).

 o A CD-R medium is automatically ejected now before writing to reset the disk
   status after a simulation run which is necessary e.g. for the
   Philips CDD2x00 recorder family.


Xcdrdao changes:

 o Added dialogs for entering meta data like UPC/EAN, ISRC code and CD-TEXT.

 o It is now possible to insert and remove samples at any place without
   touching the audio files on the disk.

 o Added a dialog for configuration of all available CD-ROM/CD-R devices.

 o Recording can now be started from the GUI. Simultaneous recording with
   multiple CD-recorders is possible if the hardware is suitable for it.

 o Created a man page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Added support for bin/cue images. A cue file can be used now wherever a
   toc-file is expected. The cue file must have exactly one FILE statement.
   The bin file name is constructed from the cue file name by replacing
   ".cue" with ".bin". Currently supported track modes: MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352,
   MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352. The 'cdd2600' driver uses the L-EC data
   contained in the MODEX/2352 track images when recording. All other drivers
   will ignore and regenerate the L-EC data.

 o The 'generic-mmc' driver has full multi session support now. The start
   address of the last and current session which must be used for the mkisofs
   option '-C x,y' can be retrieved with 'disk-info'.

s o The 'sony-cdu948' driver is included in the source package.

 o read-cd will create raw data track images (2352 byte sectors) if option
   '--read-raw' is given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cdrdao 1.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Added data track support to 'generic-mmc' driver.

 o Added Henk-Jan Slotboom's driver for Taiyo-Yuden recorders.

 o Created driver for the Teac CD-R55S recorder. Data tracks should be
   supported, too, but it is not well tested.

 o Added Cam MacKinnon's driver for the Yamaha CDR10x drive family.
   Data track support is available, too, but also not well tested.

 o Added Leon Woestenberg's bitwise-exact digital audio extraction patch
   for Plextor drives (see README.PlexDAE).

 o 'read-toc' will analyze mixed mode CDs now, but it is currently not
   perfect. Please have a look at the README.

 o Fixed failed assertion problems with 'read-toc' that occured when
   the raw P-W sub-channel data passed the CRC check but was actually
   not consistent (happened quiet often with Teac CD-ROM CD-532S drives).

 o The SCSI interface can now use Joerg Schilling's SCSI library. Cdrdao is
   reported to work on Solaris 2.6 and FreeBSD using the SCSI library.
   Max Khon provided an independent SCSI interface implementation for FreeBSD
   which can be selected when configuring.

 o Added experimental CD-TEXT support to 'read-toc'.

 o Updated xcdrdao source to compile with Gtk-- 0.99.1.

Known Limitations:

 o 'read-toc' does not work for multi session CDs.

 o 'read-toc' does not work well for CDs written in TAO mode.
