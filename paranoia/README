This is Monty's <monty@xiph.org> paranoia library that allows high quality
digital audio extraction even with scratched CDs. It is taken from the
cdparanoia-III-alpha9.5 package.

Changes:
  - Provided my own version of the 'cdrom_drive' structure and changed
    the include path for "cdda_interface.h". It is now located in
    "dao/cdda_interface.h".
  - Removed include of "../interface/smallft.h" because nothing from it
    was used.
  - Commented out the functions 'i_paranoia_firstlast()' and 
    'paranoia_seek()' to reduce the required cdda interface functions.
    Now only 'cdda_read()' is referenced by the library.
  - Added function 'paranoia_set_range()' to set the valid range of audio
    sectors.
